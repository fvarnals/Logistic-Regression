# Machine Learning - Logistic Regression Exercise

#### <em>Case study - build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
Determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams, using historical data from previous applicants as a training set for logistic regression. Task was to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s
probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.</em>

<strong>Files that I had to write code to:</strong>

<em>plotData.m</em>- Function to plot 2D classification data
<em>sigmoid.m</em>- Sigmoid Function
<em>costFunction.m</em>- Logistic Regression Cost Function
<em>predict.m</em>- Logistic Regression Prediction Function
<em>costFunctionReg.m</em>- Regularized Logistic Regression Cost
