# Machine Learning - Logistic Regression Exercise

#### <em>Case study - build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.<br>
  
#### Determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams, using historical data from previous applicants as a training set for logistic regression. Task was to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.</em>

<strong>Files that I had to write code to:</strong><br>
<em><strong>plotData.m</em></strong> - Function to plot 2D classification data<br>
<em><strong>sigmoid.m</em></strong> - Sigmoid Function<br>
<em><strong>costFunction.m</em></strong> - Logistic Regression Cost Function<br>
<em><strong>predict.m</em></strong> - Logistic Regression Prediction Function<br>
<em><strong>costFunctionReg.m</em></strong> - Regularized Logistic Regression Cost<br>
